Training AI isn't just an environmental crisis—it's a financial one.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,000
Cloud bills are exploding, and monitoring tools only show symptoms, not root causes.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Meet EcoCompute AI. The "Green FinOps" infrastructure that stops bill shock at the source.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Acting as a Gatekeeper in your CI/CD pipeline, we intercept inefficient code before it merges.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's audit a Llama 3 Attention block targeting the new NVIDIA B200.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Powered by Gemini 3, we use Google Search to fetch real-time 2026 hardware specs.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But here's the magic. We force the Agent to use a Python Sandbox to verify its math.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Watch this: It detected an anomaly, self-corrected its assumptions, and re-ran the calculation.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,000
The result? It proves that optimizing this block saves $42 per million inferences.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
EcoCompute AI. Turning AI from a financial black hole into an optimization engine.

Welcome to EcoCompute AI. Let's optimize a ResNet block.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,000
First, Gemini 3 uses Google Search to find real-time specs for the NVIDIA A100.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Next, it enters the Sandbox to mathematically verify arithmetic intensity.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,500
Wait! It detected a calculation anomaly. The memory bandwidth assumption was wrong.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Watch closely: The Agent self-corrects, switching to FP16 precision automatically.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Analysis complete. We saved 62% energy by fusing operators and using quantization.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is Green AI, powered by Gemini 3.

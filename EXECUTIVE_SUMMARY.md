# EcoCompute AI — Executive Summary

**Green FinOps Infrastructure for AI Teams**

---

## The Problem: Cloud Bill Shock

- Training a single AI model emits as much carbon as **5 cars over their lifetime**
- **99% of ML engineers** don't understand hardware physics (memory bandwidth, arithmetic intensity)
- Result: Inefficient code that costs **30-50% more** than necessary
- Monitoring tools (Datadog, Grafana) see *symptoms*; we see **root causes**

---

## The Solution: V38 Gatekeeper Architecture

A CI/CD infrastructure that intercepts expensive code **before it merges**.

### Hybrid Grounding Engine (4-Layer Verification)

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **L1** | Static AST Analysis | Instant code topology (zero hallucination baseline) |
| **L2** | Agent Token FinOps | **NEW!** Predicts multi-agent token costs (Antigravity/Gemini) |
| **L3** | Gemini 3 Pro Reasoning | 1024-token thinking budget for audit strategy |
| **L4** | Google Search Grounding | Real-time 2026 hardware specs & cloud pricing |
| **L5** | Code Execution Sandbox | Python verification of FLOPs math |

### 🌟 V38 Wisdom Pilot (Innovation Highlight)

An AI consultant powered by Gemini 3 Flash that:
- Explains **ROI and methodology** to CFOs and Engineering VPs
- Provides **real-time cost estimates** based on hardware profiles
- Offers **tiered pricing guidance** ($49 Starter → $299 Growth → Enterprise)
- Includes **daily usage limits** for freemium conversion

## Market Opportunity

- **$50B+** annual cloud GPU spend (growing 40% YoY)
- **$10B+** wasted on inefficient ML code
- No existing solution combines **code analysis + energy prediction + FinOps**

---

## The Ask

**Pre-Seed**: $50K - $100K

**Use of Funds** (12-month runway):
- Contract developers for CI/CD integrations ($30K)

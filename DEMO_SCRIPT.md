# 🎥 EcoCompute AI - Hackathon Demo Script

**Target Duration:** 60-90 Seconds
**Voiceover Tone:** Professional, Urgent, yet Optimistic. "FinOps Director" vibe.

---

### [0:00-0:10] The Problem: Cloud Bill Shock
**(Visual: Open with a blurred background of a Datadog dashboard showing a spike, then overlay the EcoCompute AI Logo.)**

**Audio:** "Training AI models isn't just an environmental crisis—it's a financial one. Cloud bills are exploding, and monitoring tools only show you the *symptoms* of high cost, not the root cause."

---

### [0:10-0:25] The Solution: The Gatekeeper
**(Visual: Show the main App Dashboard. Mouse hovers over the "CI/CD Gate" button, then clicks "Simulation".)**

**Audio:** "Meet EcoCompute AI. We are the 'Green FinOps' infrastructure that stops bill shock at the source: your code."

**(Visual: Switch to the CI/CD Simulator modal. Show the 'Strict Mode' config.)**

**Audio:** "Acting as a predictive Gatekeeper in your CI/CD pipeline, we intercept inefficient PyTorch models *before* they merge."

---

### [0:25-0:45] The Core Tech: Gemini 3 Hybrid Engine
**(Visual: Back to Main UI. Select "Llama 3 Attention (GQA)" from the dropdown. Select "NVIDIA B200" hardware. Click "Deep Energy Audit".)**

**Audio:** "Let's audit a Llama 3 Attention block targeting the new NVIDIA B200."

**(Visual: Zoom into the 'Thinking Panel'. Highlight the phase tags appearing: `[PHASE: SEARCH]`, then `[PHASE: COMPUTE]`.)**

**Audio:** "Powered by Gemini 3 Pro, we use a Hybrid Grounding Engine. First, it searches Google for real-time 2026 hardware specs—getting data that static databases lack."

---

### [0:45-0:60] The "Magic" Moment: Self-Correction
**(Visual: In the Thinking Panel, highlight the `[PHASE: CORRECTION]` tag turning yellow/orange.)**

**Audio:** "But here’s the magic. Large Language Models are bad at math. So we force Gemini to write Python code in a sandbox to verify its physics calculations."

**(Visual: Show the 'Sandbox: Active' indicator. Text stream shows: "Anomaly Detected. Self-Correcting precision assumptions...")**

**Audio:** "Watch this—it detected a bandwidth anomaly, self-corrected its precision assumptions, and re-ran the math. Zero hallucinations, pure physics."

---

### [0:60-0:75] The Result: Dollar Savings
**(Visual: Analysis completes. The 'FinOps Projection' card slides in. Highlight "+$42.50 Saved per 1M Inferences".)**

**Audio:** "The result? It doesn't just list data. It proves that optimizing this block saves 42 dollars per million inferences."

**(Visual: Click 'Export Report'.)**

**Audio:** "It auto-generates the refactored code and a compliance report for your CFO."

---

### [0:75-0:90] Outro
**(Visual: Show the 'Data Moat' visualizer briefly, then fade to Logo.)**

**Audio:** "EcoCompute AI. Turning Generative AI from a financial black hole into an optimization engine. Let's code green, and keep margins high."
